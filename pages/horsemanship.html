            <h2>Horsemanship &amp; Tips</h2>  
            <p>First-time horse buyers sometimes ask for advice, so here are a list of tips for good horsemanship I've compiled over the years.  Although I have been riding Tennessee Walking Horses for years, I came from a Quarter/Horse and Arabian background and can say that these tips will work for any breed.</p>
            <ul class="checkmark">
                <li> Do not tie your horse with a long lead. It may seem 'considerate' to do so, to allow horses to graze. But it's dangerous, because your horse can get tangled in the line and injure himself. Horses can panic and suffer deep cuts.
                </li>
                <li> No long leads in trailers, either. Tie your horse short enough so that he cannot turn his head more than ninety degrees either way. If he gets his head down and a foot over his lead, he can tear up your trailer up while injuring himself. Helping a panicking horse inside a trailer is very difficult.</li>
                <li> Do not leave halters on horses in the pasture or the stall. It's astonishing what a horse can get his halter hung on, including his own foot (while scratching his face).  Worst case scenario is death from a broken neck. </li>
                <li>Breast straps are more than decorative, they serve a function. Flopping, loose breast straps will not hold a saddle in place, so adjust the straps where the breast strap fits snugly. This ensures the saddle will not slide back.</li>
                <li>Do not feed horses in a group. Horses are competitive and often kick one another as they feed. They can injure each other -- and their owners who get into the line of fire.</li>
                <li>Pasture horses are happier. If you want your horse to stay good-tempered and pretty all year, stall him out of the damaging rays of the sun during the daytime and allow him to graze at night. He’ll stay glossy and dark, and be mentally healthier.</li>
                <li>Stay out of the horse’s mouth.  When jumping obstacles, riders can reflexively snatch their horse’s mouth for balance as they land. You can avoid this if you will take the hand you are holding the reins in (both hands if applicable) and right before the horse jumps, grab a firm handful of his mane halfway up his neck (toward his ears) with the reins locked in with his mane.  Release after you land, and he will never get hurt.</li>
                <li>Never say “whoa” unless you mean it. To slow down, talk to your horse in soothing tones and use a different verbal command than your command for halting, such as “easy” or “walk.” Reserve "whoa" for the most urgent stops.</li>
                <li>Compromise. Forward motion avoids trouble. If your horse is edgy and trying to move around against your will, you don’t want to set up a confrontation with him, but you don’t want to let him get away with disobedience, either. So, simply let him walk, but control where he is walking. As long as you are moving forward, your horse is least likely to rear or throw a fit and fall down on you.</li>
                <li>Don’t dismount immediately after riding. When you return to the barn (or trailer) after a ride, spend time just sitting on your horse to discipline him in patience, which will help keep him from becoming "barn-sour."</li>
