                <p>My name is Laura Kidder. Welcome to my ranch, Cloud 9 Walkers, home to Tennessee Walking Horses and more. I've happily been in this business for 20 years and I'd never do anything else.</p>
                <p>I am still head over heels in love with horses. Ever since I was three, I have loved their eyes, their soft noses, the noises they made, and especially they way they smelled!  I grew up with the whole Breyer model collection, all the Walter Farley books about the Chincoteague Island ponies, every horse encyclopedia, and anything horsey I could grab.  I craved my own horse to groom, feed, ride, care for and love. The only thing I could possibly do is breed horses. So I do.</p> 
                <p>The Cloud 9 Walker ranch is what came of this passion. It began as a part-time operation in 1983 and grew into a full-time ranch by 1992. I've since acquired three partners, and between us, we have a combined total of 114 years' horse training experience.</p>
                <p>Yet our operation is simple. We produce barefoot, keg, and light-shod pleasure horses with lots of traveling, camping and trail experience, derived from our own lifestyle. We train riding horses as we live, and then sell them, ready for your lives.</p> 
                <p>We practice natural horsemanship techniques on all our horses, carefully training our equine partners to think instead of just react. We subscribe to the philosophy and practice of wet saddle blankets, and train our horses to:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark">
                    <li>Flex and bend at the poll</li>
                    <li>Back on light rein</li>
                    <li>Neck rein</li>
                    <li>Forehand turn</li>
                    <li>Pivot</li>
                    <li>Side pass</li>
                    <li>Canter on correct leads</li>
                    <li>Cross any obstacle</li>
                    <li>Stand tied with patience</li>
                    <li>Respect its handler/rider</li>
                    <li>Tolerate dogs, traffic, and gunfire</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After we train a horse, we then start over with a less-experienced horse, training and guiding it, polishing it, once again. We grew as an enterprise on this model because of our special emphasis on building trust with our horses - and trust with our customers, who return again and again.</p>    

                <p>We hope to provide the best possible horse experience to you, too, through sales and services so that you can love horses as much as we do. See what we do and come for the ride!</p>
