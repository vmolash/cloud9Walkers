                <h2>Trail Horseback Riding</h2>
                <p>Relax your mind and invigorate your spirit with our trail rides. Located just 15 minutes north of downtown Houston, our rides tour the beautiful Texas River Valley Nature Preserve. Our Hill Country, River Adventure and Sunset Rides take you through the preserve to the hills in east Texas where you can ride a horse! Our River Adventure ride is a placid escape into a little-known part of Houston filled with fragrant, lush greenery and occasional wildlife viewings. We take riders out seven days a week with the last departure at 5:45 p.m. No experience is necessary.</p>

                <h3>Group ride</h3>
                <p><img src="../images/group_riding.jpg" alt="Group ride">Only $95.00 for a 2.5 - 3 hour trail ride! This ride is similar to our Three Hour Sea Tour open to whomever signs up! This is a group tour at a discounted rate because you will be riding with others not from your own party.<br><br>
                This is a walking-only tour and it leaves at 8:30 a.m. sharp. You must arrive by 8 a.m. and reservations are required. We must have at least three riders in a group in order to qualify for a discount. However, if there are only one or two riders, the ride will go out regardless, and our regular rates will apply. Enjoy a 150- to 180-minute guided ride through the nature preserve with approximately 40 to 60 minutes on the hills. Riders who weigh more than 220 pounds and up to 265 pounds are charged an additional $15 per hour for a draft horse which will be applied on the day of the ride.
